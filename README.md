## Inspiration
www.loolooloo.co is inspired by the famous Waterloo chant—Water Water Water! Loo Loo Loo! And, of course, the natural consequence of drinking lots of water, water, water, being a visit to the loo, loo, loo!

## What it does
www.loolooloo.co detects when you go to a water fountain, and sends you a text message with a custom link to an interactive map that gives you directions to the nearest bathroom. It also has a daily water tracker that incentivizes you to stay hydrated.

## How we built it
We utilized the MappedIn API to implement an indoor navigation system for building maps. The front-end was developed using React, while the back-end was powered by Node.js. Twilio's API was integrated to enable SMS notifications with custom map links.
